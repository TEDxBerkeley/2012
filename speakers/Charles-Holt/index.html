            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Bio:<br/><br/>Music and storytelling have always been a vital part of CharlesÍ life growing up in the South. However, despite thorough tutelage from his staunchly religious grandmother, who insisted upon him learning church hymns as a child, Charles never aspired to walk the path of a performing artist. He dreamed of playing professional football. After a disappointing end to his athletic career, he then pursued a career in Corporate America with IBM. After two successful years as a sales representative, he left to spearhead a regional office of another large company. A year from the date he started, he was fired. It wasnÍt until a friend encouraged his potential as a singer and actor that CharlesÍ love for music resurfaced.<br/><br/>In July1996, Charles, led by intuition, left the comforts of the South with $400 dollars for the bright lights of Broadway. He has since starred in some of the most celebrated and spectacular productions in American theatre history including Smokey JoeÍs Caf_, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Lion King. He was the first African American to play the role of ïRockyÍ in the European tour of The Rocky Horror Show. Charles adds guest starring roles in Law & Order: Criminal Intent, All My Children, the award winning independent film Anne B. Real, and the thought provoking comedy, EdÍs Trip. He received national acclaim and rave reviews for his 20-character portrayal in his one-man stage play Black Boy, based on best selling author Richard WrightÍs autobiographical landmark, as well as his portrayal of Civil Rights activist and icon, W.E.B. Du Bois in the one-man production, The Smoke King. Charles recently toured the country in Never Fight a Shark in Water, a one-man play based on the life of Gregory Bright who was exonerated after spending 27 _ years in  LouisianaÍs Angola Penitentiary for wrongful conviction of second-degree murder.<br/><br/>Charles with fellow actor Gerald C. Rivers will present and tour the world premiere event Martin & Music in January 2012. The play chronicles the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., while threading KingÍs love for music into his speeches and life experience.<br/><br/>Charles has entertained sold-out audiences around the world, including The John F. Kennedy Center The Turkish-American Association in Ankara, Turkey, and Rikers Island Correctional Facility. He speaks to groups and organizations and serves as facilitator of workshops based on his work as an artist in order to empower, encourage, and uplift  audiences everywhere.<br/><br/>Agape Media International released CharlesÍ second album Rushing Over Me project in fall 2010, after his debut album, I Am, was released to critical acclaim. Charles tours colleges, universities, and spiritual centers around the world performing his ïSoleÍ Music Concert Series: A journey through an African American quilt of song.<br/><br/>Intuitive Rebel, CharlesÍ landmark book about his journey in finding his own unique voice and life purpose will be released in Spring 2012.</p>
